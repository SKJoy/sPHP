\system\configuration.php	Take a patient look into this configuration script and your application will be up and running in less than 5 minutes.
\system\pre.php	Use this script to execute any common PHP code before your application loads. But don't make any output here.
\system\post.php	Use this script to execute any common PHP code after your application finishes. But don't make any output here.
sPHP location	Keep sPHP somewhere out of your application path which is not reachable directly by the web clients. This is a security practice applicatble for any general purpose framework.
PHP output buffer	Don't, don't and never use any output buffer related function of PHP (like ob_start, ob_flush, ob_clean, ob_end, etc.) in your sPHP application if you don't want to screw yourself.
Output compression	sPHP application output is already compressed if the client browser supports it. You don't need to put any extra effort to accomplish this.
Debug\Checkpoint	Use Debug Checkpoints to measure execution times of your application code blocks with a detailed listing of time consumption, how much went where.
