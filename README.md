# sPHP
PHP framework for stupids

# This is a framework, not an application. This alone cannot run, you can develop an application with the help of this framework that you can run.
This is a very basic application development framework with PHP, basically homegrown, to help me efficiently accomplish my projects in time as a freelancer. The fundamental goal was to make a container/shell model for application development where libraries are loaded automatically and common tasks are taken care of once and for all.

# Note
This is unlike the conventional frameworks out there, and no other framework has been followed. This might feel unfamilier in many cases, so it is adviced not compare it against anything else.
