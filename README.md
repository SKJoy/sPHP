PHP framework for stupids

This is a very basic application development framework with PHP, basically homegrown, to help me efficiently accomplish my projects in time as a freelancer. The fundamental goal was to make a container/shell model for application development where libraries are loaded automatically and common tasks are taken care of once and for all.

Note: This is unlike the conventional frameworks out there, and no other framework has been followed. This might feel unfamilier in many cases, so it adviced not compare it against anything else.
